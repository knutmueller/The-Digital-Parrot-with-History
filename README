=The Digital Parrot=

The Digital Parrot is research software; it is an implementation of the
retrieval aspects of an augmented memory system based on Cognitive
Psychology. For more information, see http://hdl.handle.net/10289/5263.

==Installation==

===Compilation===

The Digital Parrot uses Webrenderer for the map view. You'll need to
download the appropriate version of Webrenderer (Swing edition) for
your operating system here:
http://www.webrenderer.com/products/swing/product/

You should receive an archive that contains, among other files, three
jar files. You need to install these into your local maven
repository. An example for Linux and Webrenderer version 5.0.9:

$ mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.webrenderer \
-DartifactId=corecomponents-swing-linux -Dversion=5.0.9 -Dpackaging=jar \
-Dfile=corecomponents-swing-linux.jar

$ mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.webrenderer \
-DartifactId=webrenderer-swing-linux -Dversion=5.0.9 -Dpackaging=jar \
-Dfile=webrenderer-swing-linux.jar

$ mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.webrenderer \
-DartifactId=webrenderer-swing -Dversion=5.0.9 -Dpackaging=jar \
-Dfile=webrenderer-swing.jar

If you're using a different operating system or a different version of
Webrenderer, you'll need to adjust the dependencies in pom.xml
appropriately.

Then use maven to build the Digital Parrot using mvn package. This
will give you the file digital-parrot-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in the target
subdirectory.

===Webrenderer license, ontologies=== 

Create a directory called .digital-parrot in your home directory. In
this directory, create a file called parrot.properties with the
following structure:

<pre>
[map view license info]
webrenderer.license.type = <license type, eg 30dtrial>
webrenderer.license.data = <license key>
</pre>

Fill in your Webrenderer license type and key; if you downloaded the
30-day trial version, you will find this in the file TestBrowser.java
that came with the download.

Copy the directory src/main/resources/owl and its contents into your
.digital-parrot directory.

==Running==

To run the Digital Parrot on a given data file:
$ java -jar target/digital-parrot-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -f /path/to/data.rdf
